Style
=====

A guide for programming in style. ;)

1. Follow this style.
2. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) to help you programming in style. [See our basic .editorconfig](link to .editorconfig file).


Git
---
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Formatting
----------
- Avoid inline comments.
- Break long lines after 80 characters.
- Delete trailing whitespace.
- Don't include spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`.
- Don't misspell.
- If you break up an argument list, keep the arguments on their own lines and closing parenthesis on its own line.
- If you break up a chain of method invocations, keep each method invocation on its own line. Place the . at the end of each line, except the last. [Example](update example link).
- Use 2 space indentation (no tabs).
- Use an empty line between methods.
- Use spaces around operators, except for unary operators, such as !.
- Use spaces after commas, after colons and semicolons, around `{` and before ``}`.
- Use [Unix-style line endings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline).
- Use [uppercase for SQL key words and lowercase for SQL identifiers](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS).

Naming
------
- Avoid abbreviations.
- Avoid object types in names (`user_array`, `email_method`, `CalculatorClass`, `ReportModule`).
- Prefer naming classes after domain concepts rather than patterns they implement (e.g. `Guest` vs `NullUser`, `CachedRequest` vs `RequestDecorator`).

Organization
